                We’re already in the middle of January! How time flies! So the year is no more new.

                Most people see a new year as a clean slate, an opportunity to start over or make amends in order to achieve more than they did the previous year. In this blog post I will be focusing on simple things that you can do to create a conducive environment for your spiritual growth this year. I may not have a specific list of things you need to do that fit your exact situation, but I will be laying out several nuggets that could serve as guiding principles to help you accelerate in your growth in Christ this year.

                First of all, know that spiritual things are not accomplished with natural ability or acumen. So you can’t make any spiritual progress this year by relying on your own strength. You need to completely rely on the ability of the Holy Spirit to help you make significant progress in your walk with him this year. You can refer to my blog post on The Grace of the Lord Jesus Christ to understand this point more.

                <b>Then he answered and spoke to me, saying, “This is the word of the LORD to Zerubbabel, saying, ‘Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit,’ says the LORD of hosts (Zechariah 4:6).</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                Many people have difficulty maintaining a consistent prayer life or their bible study practice. Before implementing any strategies to overcome this, you need to decide that you will partner with the Holy Spirit to help you advance in your journey with him this year. That’s actually why he’s always with you. He is both willing and able to help you. So you need to live and do everything this year with the consciousness of his sufficiency in all you do. Don’t have a mental picture of defeat, or a picture of having the same story as last year. Have one of victory and success because the one who lives in you is greater than any opposition or limitation you could ever have or face.
            </p>
            <h3>Determination</h3>
            <p>
                Dependency on the Holy Spirit doesn’t mean you just sit and wait for him to do everything for you. It’s believing that he has now supplied you with the ability and so therefore you take the required actions. As someone said, “responsibility” is your response to his ability. So, just like you set goals for other areas of your life, you need to set goals for your spiritual progress too. It could be that you want to get deeper in word study or you want to have a more vibrant prayer life. Whatever you want to do you need to make up your mind to be super intentional about it. This might require you to change your schedule or sacrifice some things. In order to make progress, certain steps needs to be taken if not you’ll remain where you are. But let it not just be about ticking off a list in order to please God because it doesn’t work that way. Let everything you do concerning your spiritual progress this year (bible study, prayer, attending church programs, etc) be done with the intention of building a deeper level of intimacy with the Holy Spirit because that’s the most important thing. That’s the foundation for everything God will do in your life this year and beyond. See my post on Secret Place Virgins if you need help with kick starting your prayer life and maintaining a living relationship with God.
