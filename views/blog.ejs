        <h1>Nuggets to Boost your Spiritual Growth this Year</h1>
        <p>Most people see a new year as a clean slate, an opportunity to start over or make amends in order to achieve more than they did the previous year. In this blog post I will be focusing on simple things that you can do to create a conducive environment for your spiritual growth this year. I may not have a specific list of things you need to do that fit your exact situation, but I will be laying out several nuggets that could serve as guiding principles to help you accelerate in your growth in Christ this year.</p>

        <p>First of all, know that spiritual things are not accomplished with natural ability or acumen. So you can’t make any spiritual progress this year by relying on your own strength. You need to completely rely on the ability of the Holy Spirit to help you make significant progress in your walk with him this year. You can refer to my blog post on The Grace of the Lord Jesus Christ to understand this point more.</p>
        
        <p><i>Then he answered and spoke to me, saying, “This is the word of the LORD to Zerubbabel, saying, ‘Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit,’ says the LORD of hosts (Zechariah 4:6).</i></p>
        
        <p>Many people have difficulty maintaining a consistent prayer life or their bible study practice. Before implementing any strategies to overcome this, you need to decide that you will partner with the Holy Spirit to help you advance in your journey with him this year. That’s actually why he’s always with you. He is both willing and able to help you. So you need to live and do everything this year with the consciousness of his sufficiency in all you do. Don’t have a mental picture of defeat, or a picture of having the same story as last year. Have one of victory and success because the one who lives in you is greater than any opposition or limitation you could ever have or face.</p>
